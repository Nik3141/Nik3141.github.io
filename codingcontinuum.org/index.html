			<p>
				Want to learn how to program in a comprehensive and practical way for $0.00? You're in the right place. Let's get started.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you already have experience with programming and just want to make sure you haven't missed anything, or you just want a quick refresher, have a read through the <a href="java.html">Java</a> or <a href="python.html">Python</a> courses.
				However, if you're starting from scratch, consider beginning with the <a href="programming-fundamentals.html">Programming Fundamentals</a> course, which talks about coding concepts separately from any specific programming language.
				You can then move on to the <a href="procedural-programming.html">Procedural Programming</a> and <a href="oop-programming.html">OOP (Object Oriented Programming)</a> pages.
				Once you have these concepts firmly under your belt, you can go to the language-specific courses to learn how to implement these ideas in code.
