		<h3>
			<p>
				Want to learn how to program in a comprehensive and practical way for $0.00? You're in the right place. Let's get started.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you already have experience with programming and just want to make sure you haven't missed anything, or you just want a quick refresher, have a read through the <a href="java.html">Java</a> or <a href="python.html">Python</a> pages.
				However, if you're starting from scratch, consider beginning with the <a href="programming-fundamentals.html">Programming Fundamentals</a> page, which talks about coding concepts separately from any specific programming language.
				You can then move on down the list of pages below until you have all of the requisite concepts under your belt and can visit the language-specific courses to learn how to implement these ideas in code.
			</p>
			<p>Feedback is strongly encouraged and greatly appreciated, and can be submitted to my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Nik3141/Nik3141.github.io/issues">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
