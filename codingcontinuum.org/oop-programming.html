		<h1>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>

		<h2>Objects</h2>

		<h3>
			<p>
				Object Oriented Programming attempts to make programming more understandable and intuitive to humans by introducing the idea of an <i>object</i>.
				In the real world, we can group objects into categories which all have the same properties and behaviors, but each object might have a different value for a particular property.
				For example, all bicycles have a frame made out of some material; however, different bicycles might be made out of different materials.
			</p>
			<p>
				OOP lets us define our own 'categories' of objects, which we call <i>classes</i>.
				These classes will have properties and behaviors: for example, if we made a bicycle class, it might have a wheelSize property, a handleShape property, etc.
				We can then make specific <i>instances</i> of those classes, which actually have values for those variables; each instance we make could have different values, but they'd all be the same type of object: a bicycle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another way to think of it is like this: a class is like a blueprint or a general description of what properties and behaviors an object might have; it's the <i>idea</i> of what a bicycle is.
				An instance of an object is an actual thing you'd encounter out in the real world; it's the bicycle which might almost knock you off the pavement while you're on your evening walk.
				The bicycle idea tells us that bicycles have a frame which has a color, but different bicycles can have different color frames.
