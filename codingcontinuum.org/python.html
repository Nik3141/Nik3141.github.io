				Computers, in their most basic form, are machines that follow instructions which we give them.
				That's all they are! Almost anything can be a computer: for examples see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BOvLL8ok8I">this</a> video about a computer made of a marble dropper or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdmODVYPDLA">this</a> video about a computer made in the card game Magic the Gathering.
				But when we think of computers, we don't think of card games: we think of electronics and circuitry.
				So let's talk about what the components of a modern electronic computer are, and then we'll discuss how they work together to create the interface we see on our screens.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, let's talk about input and output, which is generally abbreviated to I/O or IO.
				You can connect a myriad of input devices to your computer: keyboards, microphones, touchscreens, cameras, etc, while computer output is normally through audio devices, like speakers, visual devices, such as displays, or haptic devices, such as vibrating game controllers.
				You can connect all of these and more to your computer because a computer processes information in the form of binary numbers (if you don't know how binary numbers work, click <a href="binary-numbers.html">here</a>), and all of these devices can translate between binary information and the physical information we can sense and perceive.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, lets talk about the computing part of the computer which actually carries out instructions: the processor.
				The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the central control unit for the computer.
				It performs one instruction at a time in something called the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), storing any intermediate results in a temporary form of memory.
				It might seem impossible that your iPhone or laptop computer is a device which can only do one operation at a time;
				however, a CPU has a very high processing speed or clock speed, which allows it to create the complex interface we experience.
				Clock speed, which refers to the number of operations possible per second, is measured in GHz (Gigahertz).
				A modern i7 computer chip can run at 4.5 GHz (4,500,000,000 Hz), which means it can perform 4,500,000,000 operations per second.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, we have to talk about memory. There are two types of memory: volatile memory and non-volatile memory.
				The chief distinction is that volatile memory loses its data when it loses power, while non-volatile memory can lose power and will retain its data.
				Volatile memory is most often used as short term memory for a CPU to hold intermediate results during calculations, because it doesn't matter if this information is lost later, and volatile memory is much quicker to read and write information from and to than non-volatile memory.
				However, non-volatile memory doesn't need power to maintain, so even though it is slower to write and read to, it is useful for storing files long-term in the form of SD cards, USB memory sticks, or hard drives.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is one additional computer part we should talk about, because even though it isn't in all computers, it's useful to know about.
				The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a special processor used for rendering images to a display.
				Due to how it works
