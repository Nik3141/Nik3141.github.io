			<h3>
			
				<p class="animate2">
					I started out writing this site as a way to establish my own little corner of the internet and put some basic information about me out there.
					However, as I started adding more pages it ended up being a really transformative experience where I learned a lot about myself.
					Hopefully you can also learn something about me when you read this, and maybe it even inspires you to write a similar website about yourself.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<p class="animate3">
					Some information about my hobbies and daily life:
				</p>
				
				
				
				<p class="animate4">
					I am 17 years old and live in Southern California with my mom, dad, younger brother, and our dog.
					I enjoy running for the XC <span class="nowrap">(Cross Country)</span> team at my school, as well as playing many sports, such as tennis, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, basketball, and ping pong <span class="nowrap">(if that's considered a sport)</span>.
					I also like playing video games: Minecraft, War Thunder, and Astroneer for the most part.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<p class="animate5">
					I love music, both playing it and listening to it.
					I've played the violin and the piano for around 10 and 5 years respectively, and I aspire to learn the flute at some point -
					I can play the soprano recorder decently, but it's really not the same.
					I love playing music because it can help me express my thoughts and emotions, and if I'm upset or agitated it's a great outlet to calm down.
					It's also a very stable part of my life: even with a global pandemic going on I still know that every day I need to practice.
					The unchanging nature of playing an instrument can make it both a life-long passion and a source of stability, even when the outside world is going crazy, so
					I think music - and expressive art in general - should be emphasized more in schools.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<p class="animate6">
					In terms of education, which is really just another hobby of mine, I love math, both learning it and teaching it to other people.
					My favorite branch of math so far is calculus, especially multivariable calculus, because it's extremely fascinating to me how it can be used to model the real world.
					Triple integrals suck though.
					COVID, with all the bad that came with it, actually had a silver lining, which is that it gave me the impetus to start tutoring people in math, something I'd wanted to do for a long time.
					I've found that when teaching a subject - for example: quadratic functions and equations - I actually end up diving a lot deeper than I did the first time around learning it.
					A lot of facets of various subjects are a little beyond the scope of an introductory course, so teaching helps me go back and revisit topics to learn more about them.
					This is great for helping me aquire a much deeper understanding.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<p class="animate7">
					Another subject that I love is love physics, which is no surprise because it's basically just math applied to the real world.
					As I took AP Physics, it felt like I was really learning the why and how of all sorts of processes and interactions I'd taken for granted, which was pretty epic.
					Knowing why door handles are located far from door hinges, or how a satellite is 'falling' around the earth, or why you rotate faster in a swivel chair when you tuck your limbs in is really satisfying.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<p class="animate8">
					Another subject that is related to math that I really enjoyed was computer science. I took AP Computer Science A, so we learned Java, and I'll be honest, the primary inspiration for me to take that class was wanting to make a Minecraft mod.
					However, I actually came to like programming as an activity in itself, and I was able to make a functioning <i>English</i> -> <i>Pig Latin</i> translator.
					Definitely a really quirky project, but one that helped me learn how to think algorithmically, so as a learning exercise it was really effective.
					During quarantine I resolved to teach myself Python, so after learning the basics of the syntax I used pygame to make a series of better and better Asteroids clones.
					I'm actually working on a final version right now that's no longer a clone but instead is its own game, so when it's done I'll put a download link here.
					Designing games looks like it might become a hobby of mine in the future because it's really fun to see your program make people smile.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<p class="animate9">
					Despite what you might expect, I don't categorize myself as a 'math/science person'.
					Obviously, I like STEM subjects, but I don't really fall into either of the math/science person or history/language-arts person archetypes, because along with everything above,
					I also really like writing, literature, history, geography, anthropology, linguistics...all of the 'social sciences' pretty much.
					I just have an abiding interest in learning things and becoming more knowledgeable in general.
					My goal isn't to be a walking encyclopedia (although that wouldn't hurt);
					I want to 'hone my blunt instrument into a fine cutting point' - to discard ignorance to become a more capable person.

					This website is a static website, meaning it just serves the webpage content to your client but doesn't carry out any further communication using PHP or whatnot.
					I wrote it this way because I wanted to learn how to host a website on a Raspberry Pi in my house, but I also didn't want any security issues stemming from my inexperience.
