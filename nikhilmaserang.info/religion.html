				<p class="animate1">
					Religion and philosophy are really just a person's views on the nature of their experience in the world.
					Things like: What am I? Why am I here? What <i>is</i> here? etc.
					These questions are something that Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Taoists, Atheists, Agnostics,
					and <i>literally everyone else</i> have to wrestle with.
					The only difference between these groups is the answers they come up with,
					and because the objective answers to those questions are pretty much unknowable, it's ridiculous when people fight over who is right.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate2">
					The reason I say that the answers are unknowable is because in my experience, we can't actually really prove anything,
					because we ourselves are just a subjective consciousness; a brain in a jar made of meat and bones, so to speak.
					This is pretty much the fundamental tenet of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">Solipsism</a>.
					This limitation means that all we know for sure is that we are thinking and experiencing,
					and so we have to make a lot of assumptions to get through life.
					We have to assume, for example, that we aren't the only real person in the universe;
					that the universe wasn't created at some arbitrary point in the past, set up as if it had been running for 13.7 billion years
					(<a href="http://www.last-thursday.org/">Last Thursdayism</a>); that we aren't living in some type of advanced simulation; etc.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate3">
					Sure, I could live my life questioning everything, all the time,
					but because the answers to many of those questions make little real difference to my everyday life,
					I feel comfortable making some assumptions.
					For example, even if the universe really was created last Thursday, <i>I</i> have no way of knowing if the universe will continue or not,
					and no power to really affect it in some meaningful way if it's going to end,
					so I'm just going to assume that I and everyone else are going to continue to exist, and carry on.
					Another example: some people might think that if they are the only 'real' person, they can do whatever they want.
					But even if the rest of the population are robots, they are still going to behave as if they are real,
					so there will always be repercussions for any actions I take; I can't just walk around robbing people, because I will go to jail.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate4">
					What this boils down to is that since the world seems to be so real, it's best to act as though it is.
					This doesn't mean that we shouldn't think about why things happen or about the nature of the universe:
					it just means we shouldn't have armed conflicts or aggressive arguments about who's right.
					This is where <a href="https://possibilian.com/">Possibilianism</a> comes in:
					We can look at all of the different possibilities in a type of 'possibility sphere',
					and use the principles of logic and probability to decide which ideas are the most likely.
					If some ideas are of similar probability, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's Razor</a>
					to determine which is better.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate5">
					This means that as a Possibilian, I don't say "There is no God" or "There is a God";
					I say "There might be a God, and it might even be the Christian God,
					but since there are so many possible Gods out there <span class="nowrap">(an infinite number, in fact)</span>, it seems rather hasty to pick one God over all the rest."
					Of course, we could consider Pascal's wager,
					which effectively states that you should believe in the God who gives out the harshest punishment to nonbelievers,
					but I'd rather take that risk and remain intellectually curious than give up like that.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate6">
					Really, a Possibilian is someone who is applying the scientific method to their philosophical beliefs;
					a person who is capable and willing to hold multiple possibilities at the same time and say "I don't know yet".
					As Stephen Hawking <span class="nowrap">(Rest In Peace)</span> pointed out, we can never <i>prove</i> a scientific theory.
					We can only try to find the best model to describe our world, and then keep testing it until it fails.
					At that point, we have to discard it or modify it and try to find a new, even better model.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate7">
					Something that bugs me is when people talk about our society going 'downhill'
					- having a complete loss of morality - as a result of the decline of traditional religion.
					In my view, this isn't a real concern,
					not only because I don't see religion as a great way to endow moral values <span class="nowrap">(see: the Holocaust; Imperialism)</span>,
					but also because people can definitely have morals without religion.
					A person's religion is their way of understanding the universe, and although many religions do espouse a particular code of behavior,
					being an atheist, an agnostic, or a possibilian in no way precludes having one.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate8">
					In my view, a moral value is really some general rule of thumb for behavior that helps society when a large amount of people hold it.
					For example, the greater the amount of people who believe murder is bad, the lesser the chance that someone will be murdered.
					My personal moral framework centers on what I call the 'Do No Harm Rule'; it's very simple: don't let your actions have a negative effect on the world.
					Of course, 'negative' is somewhat subjective, but we can just think of a negative action as being detrimental for a person or society in the generally understood way.
					No cheating by doing something horrible and pretending that it's helping society. <span class="nowrap">(<i>*ahem* Thanos</i>)</span>
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate9">
					The fact that the world's religions are full of beautiful wisdom like "Love Thy Neighbor"
					and have truly inspirational founders and philosophers behind them, yet have followers which don't see this message as important,
					has really dissilusioned me with traditional organized religion.
					I know that many religious people will split their bread with the person who has none
					and go on missionary trips to impoverished places to lend a hand in helping these people's lives; in other words, they are model citizens and people of faith.
					However, in the United States, the majority of people are Christians, yet a minority act like true Christians,
					'feeding the hungry, clothing the poor, and tending to the sick'.
					We probably have the worst social support networks in the developed world,
					and the complete lack of action over this, and the overt nativism, racism, and bigotry which come out of many religious groups really frustrates me.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate10">
					I think the most important thing for humanity to do in the near future is realize that we all live on this relatively small blue orb,
					completely alone in the cosmos, and that the divisions between us are pretty much artificial and of our own making.
					Whether people come to this realization through organized religion, private spirituality, or some form of atheism, I don't really care.
					It just needs to happen before we tear ourselves apart.
					The movie trope is that humanity, having met with an extraterrestrial entity for the first time,
					finally understands that people have many more similarities than differences.
					Seeing as First Contact might not happen anytime soon, I hope we can do it before then.
				</p>
				
				<p class="animate11">
					So this is my perspective on religion/life philosophy...I put a great deal of thought into it, so I hope you found it enlightening in some amount.
					Please be aware that I don't mean to offend anyone, and I think that if you are religious and you've found faith in something, that's good for you.
					Like Pi Patel, I'm a supporter of people finding their own spirituality in their own way, and as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else, that's fine by me.
